Design Smell
Unused class - printReceipt.java

Code Smell
1. God class
Both seller and customer in OrderingApplication.java use User class to be initialized

2. Data clump
There is only one string address in Address.java regardless of multiple strings
    such as street, city, state.

3. Data class
There is no methods such getDateCreated() and getTotalItemsNo() to make the class to specialized.
